/**
 * Mosaic Tile Program
 * 
 * <p>Mosaic is a GUI program that will create a tiled window that has randomly generated
 * circles and squares. These shapes are filled with a random color and a random
 * letter is placed over the top of the shape.
 * 
 * <p>There is some interaction that the user can have with the program. There is a button
 * that will randomize all of the tiles and another button will randomize only one single
 * tile. The user can also change the layout of the tiles. The default layout is a grid
 * of 12 x 12, but the user can set any number of rows and columns in the input boxes.
